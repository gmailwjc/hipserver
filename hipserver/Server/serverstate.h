#ifndef SERVERSTATE_H_

/*
 * These state variables describe the internal state of the server.
 *
 * Notes:
 * The HART-IP server works in parallel with a "APP program" which
 * emulates a HART token-passing device.  It consumes HART requests
 * replies with HART responses through Posix mqueues.
 *
 * The server may launch in two different ways:
 *
 * - standard operation: the hart-ip server's command-line arguments
 * 		*are* the command line for the APP program.  After the server
 * 		launches, it spawns the APP process using the command line.
 * 		When the server is terminating, it messages the APP to quit
 * 		and waits for it to terminate before terminating itself.
 * 		example:
 * 			$ hipserver hip_native_demo
 *
 * 	- developer *debugging* operation: APP developer launches the
 * 		hart-ip server using the command line with no embedded APP
 * 		command line.   The server runs to the point that it pends
 * 		waiting a response from the APP to the INIT message.
 * 		then developer can start the  APP up using a development environment
 * 		and debug the application.
 * 		example:
 * 			$ hipserver
 * 			$ <launch developer IDE here>
 *
 * 		the APP must launch after the server, as the server owns the mqueues.
